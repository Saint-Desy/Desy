Getting started
To navigate our codebase with confidence, see the introduction to working in the docs repository 🎊. For more information on how we write our markdown files, see "Using Markdown and Liquid in GitHub Docs."

Check to see what types of contributions we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code ✨.

Issues
Create a new issue
If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

Solve an issue
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See "Label reference" for more information. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

Make Changes
Make changes in the UI
Click Make a contribution at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the .md file where you can make your changes and create a pull request for a review.
